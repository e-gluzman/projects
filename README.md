# projects

This repository contains some of the projects I have worked on:

1. Analysing a huge open access dataset of psychometric and biometric data. I build regression models to predict depression from blood test results.
2. Analysing team performance with social graphs.
3. Extracting infortmation units (concepts) from product presentations
